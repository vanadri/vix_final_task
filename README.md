# Virtual Internship Experience - Final Task
## as Data Scientist at id/x partners
*Project purpose:* Build a classification model that can predict credit risk with the aim of minimizing the risk of borrowing credit in a lending company.

<br>
The target data is divided into two parts according to the loan_status information:
<ul>
  <li>Charged_Off (bad debt)</li>
  <li>Fully_Paid (debt is fully paid)</li>
</ul>

Various data analyzes were carried out to determine the correlation between data features.

The preprocessing stage is carried out to clean and prepare the dataset before entering the modeling stage.

The Artificial Neural Network method is formed and used to predict credit lending data.
